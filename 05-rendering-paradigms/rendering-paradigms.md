# Rendering Paradigms in Nextjs
- SSR
- CSR
- In React the files(html,css,js) are served on client side upon request of client. Upon every request on any route the same files are served, browser handles everything
- In nextjs the page we request  html come for this page and rsc comes for other pages
# Dynamic Vs Static rendering

- Next js generates static pages as html(it is also server side rendering) on build time but dynamic pages are served on the fly when user requests it.
- Static pages are generated as html files during build but dynamic pages are generated on the fly
- Both client side rendering and server side rendering happens in nextjs
