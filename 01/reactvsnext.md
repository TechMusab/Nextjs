# React vs Nextjs
- Nextjs is server side rendered but react is is client side rendered
- In nextjs the code is compiled at server side and send it to browser but in react the browser compiles the code
- use `use client` for making component for client interaction
- if using use client code will be run on server and also on browser
- Nextjs better for SEO
- Faster speed
